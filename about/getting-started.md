{{ site.product_name }} is the source for creating consistent, accessible and trustworthy services for NICE. It’s aimed at developers, designers and content editors. Please use our relevant guides below to get started:

## Developers

Use NICE Design System to build up from the [foundations]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link foundations/index.md %}). Combine [components]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link components/index.md %}) together to create pages. Follow our [technical]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link technical/index.md %}) guides to meet our standards. But first you'll need to install the product:

## Designers

If you’re looking to create a visual concept or prototype. Use our design kit, which contains all the foundations and componenets within an Axure file. Ensure that you have a clear understanding of what's already exists within the design system, and how and why to use them.

If none of the existing patterns work for the needs of your users. Look into either adapting an existing pattern, or creating a new one, of which we have setup a guide on how you would approach that.

## Content team

Our components are not currently supported with Orchard. Our aim moving forward is to support all our users, and we will keep you up to date when we have plans in place to allow you to implement our components into Orchard.
