## Why?

To group related content into a box or to visually break up a page layout.

## Usage

Use panels in side panel as an aside from the main content, or to group related content.

Panels have a default padding and remove the margin top/bottom from the first/last children to maintain consistent padding.

Panels have a margin above and below by default to separate from the surrounding content. Use with <a href="{{ site.baseurl }}{% link foundations/spacing.md %}#css-classes">spacing CSS classes</a> e.g. `mb--e` or `mt--0` to adjust the margins if necessary.

## Variants

You can choose from the default panel (also called "supporting") and four additional variations:

- Primary
- Impact
- Impact (alternative)
- Inverse

For examples of the variants and for examples of the HTML to use, see Storybook.
