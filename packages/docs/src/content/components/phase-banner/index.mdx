description: Alpha and beta beta banners clearly identify non-live services

## Why?

If your service is on the NICE subdomain and is within alpha or beta you must have a phase banner which reflects this.

## Usage

Your banner must sit below the TopHat, and above the page breadcrumb. You should use a ‘feedback’ link to collect feedback about your service. Ensure the user can return to their previous point in the page, having opened a dedicated page or form.

## Variants

### Alpha

```
<p class="phase-banner">
    <span class="phase-banner__tag">
        <span class="tag tag--impact tag--alpha">Alpha</span>
    </span>
    <span class="phase-banner__label">
       This is a new service – your <a href="#">feedback</a> will help us to improve it.
    </span>
</p>
```

### Beta

```
<p class="phase-banner">
    <span class="phase-banner__tag">
        <span class="tag tag--impact tag--beta">Beta</span>
    </span>
    <span class="phase-banner__label">
       This is a new service – your <a href="#">feedback</a> will help us to improve it.
    </span>
</p>
```
