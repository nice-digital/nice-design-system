## Why?

This component can be used as a major separator or header to create impact.

It expands out of any container to span the full width of the viewport, and can accommodate a background image.

Background images should not contain text and should not be instrumental to the context of the page. When you're using background images in a responsive layout you can't guarantee what parts of the image will be visible at any given time.
