## Filter Summary

<Panel>
	<FilterSummary
	sorting={[{ label: "Date", active: true },{ label: "Title"}]}
	activeFilters={[{label: "Guidance"},{label: "Pathway"}]}
	headingLevel={3}
	>
		Showing results 1 to 10 out of 1209
	</FilterSummary>
</Panel>

### What is it?

A summary of the results on your page which updates as you apply filters from the filter panel. Shows how many results have been returned in total, and on that page.

Allows you to remove filters, and to sort the returned data.

## Filter panel, filter group, filter options, filter by filter by input

<Panel>
	<FilterPanel heading="Example filter panel" headingLevel={3}>
		<FilterByInput label="Filter by name" name="Filter by name" />
		<FilterGroup heading="Filter by updated date">
			<FilterOption>
				Today
			</FilterOption>
			<FilterOption>Last 30 days</FilterOption>
			<FilterOption isSelected={true}>
				Last year
			</FilterOption>
		</FilterGroup>
	</FilterPanel>
</Panel>

### What are they?

A set of components used for filtering results. The filter panel contains various filters which can either be set options that can be selected which are held in a filter group, or can be a filter by input.

You can have multiple groups of filters in a filter panel, and can combine filter groups with filter by input within the panel.

There should be one filter panel on the page holding the various filters.

## Usage

### Positioning

The Filter Summary should be positioned above the results, and the Filter Panel should be positioned to the left of the results.

### Variants

For the filter by input, you can use any standard input, but it defaults to a text input.

You can use any of the [variants on our input component](http://localhost:6006/?path=/story/foundations-input--try-it-out) such as an error message or hint text.

For the filter group, you can indicate how many filters are currently selected.

<Panel>
	<FilterPanel heading="Example filter panel" headingLevel={3}>
		<FilterByInput
			label="Filter by last updated date"
			name="Filter by date"
			type="date"
		/>
		<FilterByInput
			label="Filter by users name"
			name="Filter by name"
			inputProps={{
				hint: "Enter your search term here",
				error: true,
				errorMessage: "You can only search for names"
			}}
		/>
		<FilterGroup
			heading="Filter by type of guidance"
			selectedCount={2}
		>
			<FilterOption isSelected={true}>Guidance</FilterOption>
			<FilterOption>Technology Appraisals</FilterOption>
			<FilterOption isSelected={true}>Quality Statements</FilterOption>
		</FilterGroup>
	</FilterPanel>
</Panel>

### Content

Avoid long text for the filter options. Option text should be as simple as possible, one or two words.

If you change the text on the filter by input button, ensure it is clear what that button does.

### Accessibility

All colours used meet accessibility requirements.

Tap target meets minimum size requirements (44 x 44 pixels).

### Fallback when javascript isn't available

When javascript is unavailable, the filter panel acts as a form. You should provide a method and action for the form. A button will appear at the bottom of the filter panel to submit the form and filter the results.
