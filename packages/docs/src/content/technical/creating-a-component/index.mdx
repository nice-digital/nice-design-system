import { Alert } from "@nice-digital/nds-alert";

So you're looking to create a new component for the design system? If you haven't used them before, Lerna and the monorepo structure can be a bit intimidating at first so this guide will hopefully just give you the bits you need.

## Scaffold your component

There are three ways to do this. You can either:

- Copy an existing component and go through systematically renaming everything (MOST POPULAR), or
- Create the folder and `npm init` a new package yourself inside a new component folder, or
- use the [lerna create command](https://github.com/lerna/lerna/tree/main/commands/create#readme) which will do the basic scaffolding for you.

Either way, the structure you want to end up with is roughly this:

- [nds-my-component.d.ts](.\nds-my-component\nds-my-component.d.ts)
- [package.json](.\nds-my-component\package.json)
- [README.md](.\nds-my-component\README.md)
- [scss/](.\nds-my-component\scss)
  - [my-component.scss](.\nds-my-component\scss\my-component.scss)
- [src/](.\nds-my-component\src)
  - [MyComponent.js](.\nds-my-component\src\MyComponent.js)
- [\_\_tests\_\_](.\nds-my-component__tests__)
  - [nds-my-component.test.js](.\nds-my-component__tests__\nds-my-component.test.js)

	<p><b>Info!</b></p>
	<p>A checklist of parts that make up one of our components would look like this:</p>
	<ul>
		<li>package.json</li>
		<li>Component</li>
		<li>Types</li>
		<li>Tests</li>
		<li>Stories</li>
		<li>Documentation page (stub it out at least)</li>
		<li>readme.md</li>
	</ul>
</Alert>
Once you've scaffolded your component, you need to do a few bits to get the rest of the design system packages aware of it.

There are two ways to do this. You can either:

- Manually add your new component as a dependency to the `packages/docs`, `packages/storybook`, `packages/dev-app` and `components/design-system` packages and run `npm run bootstrap` from the root to link everything together, or
- Use the [lerna add command](https://github.com/lerna/lerna/tree/main/commands/add#readme) to add the dependency one by one as you need to.

Whichever way you go you need to remember to **add any SCSS dependency to the design-system SCSS imports!** otherwise it won't get rolled into the package that gets built and deployed to the CDN, and the non-React CMS won't be able to use it.

Either way, when you're done, you should be able to import your new component into the documentation, Storybook, or dev-app packages as expected.

```jsx
		import { MyComponent } from "@nice-digital/nds-my-component";
```
