import { IconList } from "../../../components/partials/icon-list/IconList";

## Guidance

Avoid unnecessary decoration - only use icons if there’s a real user need:

- if icons are needed ensure they are clear, simple and accompanied by relevant text
- don’t hide functionality under icons
- icons should be easily recognizable
- keep icon designs simple and schematic.

## The icons

<IconList />

## Usage

There are several ways to use icons with the Design System:

- [React components](#react-components), when you're in control of React-generated markup (optionally with TypeScript)
- [icon font](#icon-font), for when you're working with raw HTML or [in SASS](#sass), for writing a bespoke component
- [SVG icons directly](#svg-icons), for when you're doing something bespoke.

Use the method that best suits your use-case. Each of the methods is explained in detail below.

## React components

Use the React (and TypeScript) versions of the icons when you're using React to generate markup in a web app.

The `@nice-digital/icons` npm package ships with a React component for each icon. There is both an ES5 version in the _lib_ folder (if you're not transipling _node_modules_) or an ES6 version in the _es_ folder. Both of these folders come with corresponding TypeScript definitions in .d.ts files.

Note: each React component is also available in source TypeScript in the _ts_ folder to support building from source if you transpile _node_modules_.

Import the component from the _lib_ or _es_ folder to use it in React e.g. `import Chevronright from "@nice-digital/icons/lib/ChevronRight";`. Then use it like any normal React component e.g. `<ChevronRight />`.

Each React component comes with the following props by default:

```
width="1em"
height="1em"
viewBox="0 0 512 512"
fill="none"
xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"
className="icon"
aria-hidden={true}
focusable="false"
```

Any additional props are spread onto the `svg` element so you can pass in other attributes as needed for example:

```jsx
<ChevronRight className={styles.icon} data-tracking="Something" />
```

## Icon font

Our icon font is great for when you're working with raw HTML and want to use icons, for example in Orchard, without copying large chunks of SVG markup.

We compile our source SVG icon files into a custom web font. This allows us to use icons easily in HTML markup.

### Icon markup

Use the following markup for using the icon font in HTML:

```html
<span class="icon icon--syndication" aria-hidden="true"></span>
```

Note the following:

- hide from screenreaders with `[aria-hidden="true"]`
- use BEM style CSS classes (e.g. `icon icon--NAME`)
- use an empty `span` tag (not `<i>`).

Icon classes cannot be directly combined with other clases or components. Instead, add a nested `<span>` and apply the icon classes to the `<span>`:

```html
<div class="some-component">
	<span class="icon icon--syndication" aria-hidden="true"></span>
</div>
```

Note: there are also [SASS functions and mixins](#usage-in-sass) available for building custom components.

### Margins

Often, icons are used inline with text, for example:

```html
<span class="icon icon--syndication"></span> Syndication
```

Make sure there is a space between the icon and the text.

Alternatively, if you have spacing modifiers enabled (with `$nds-include-spacing-modifiers: true` in SASS) use a class of `mr--c` to put space between the icon and text:

```html
<span class="icon icon--syndication mr--c"></span>Syndication
```

### Usage in SASS

There is a generated SASS map, function and mixin available for advanced use-cases like bespoke components. However, the React components should be sufficient in most cases. Use the SASS function and mixin like this:

```
.search {
    &__btn {
        @include nice-icon(search);
    }

    // or
    &__btn {
        @include nice-icons-base;

        &:before {
            content: nice-icon(search);
            display: block;
        }
    }
}
```

### Custom URL

The icon font files (WOFF and WOFF2) are loaded from the _/fonts/_ directory by default. This can be overridden with the `$nice-icons-base-path` variable in your application's SASS. For example:

- serve fonts from a different folder (e.g. `$nice-icons-base-path: '/assets/icons/';`)
- serve fonts from a CDN (e.g. `$nice-icons-base-path: 'https://cdn.nice.org.uk/fonts/';`).

### Icon font path

The icon font files are included with the _dist/fonts_ folder i.e. at _node_modules\@nice-digital\icons\dist_.

To serve these they either need to be copied into an app directory or served directly, like the following ExpressJS example.

If you're using node and Express then use the following method to serve the font files (WOFF2 and WOFF2) directly:

```
const express = require("express"),
    path = require("path");

const app = express();

app.use("/fonts", express.static(path.join(__dirname, "./node_modules/@nice-digital/icons/dist/")));
```

## SVG icons

The _src_ folder of the icons package contains the raw SVG files. These SVG files are used to generate both the React components and icon font. In most cases you won't need the SVGs themselves and can use the React components or icon font. However, the src folder is included in the npm package in case you need to do something bespoke.
