## Showing & hiding

Use the following selectors for visibility:

- `.show` and `.hide` to toggle between display block/none
- or `.show--i` or `.show--ib` for inline/inline-block respectively
- `.invisibile` and `.visibile` to toggle between visibility hidden/visible

Also see the [accessibility section](#accessibility) for showing/hiding content for screenreaders

## Orientation

Use the following selectors for visibility on different orientations:

- `.show-landscape`
- `.hide-landscape`
- `.show-portrait`
- `.hide-portrait`

```
<p class="show-landscape">
    This is visible only on <strong>landscape</strong> orientations
</p>
<p class="show-portrait">
    This is visible only on <strong>portrait</strong> orientations
</p>
```

## Responsive helpers

Use the following classes to manage visibility across breakpoints. If you're writing a custom component, consider using media queries to achieve this, rather than using these classes.

### Hiding by screen width

- `.hide-only-*` - hides an element for the specified breakpoint only
- `.hide-from-*` - hides for the specified breakpoint and above
- `.hide-until-*` - hides from 0px wide up until the breakpoint, and displays it as `block` above
- `.hide-until-*--i` - hides from 0px wide up until the breakpoint, and displays it as `inline` above
- `.hide-until-*--ib` - hides from 0px wide up until the breakpoint, and displays it as `inline-block`> above

```
<p class="hide-until-md--ib">
    This is hidden until 'md' breakpoint and up, where it is displayed as inline-block
</p>
<p class="hide-from-md">
    This is hidden from 'md' breakpoint and up
</p>
<p class="hide-only-md">
    This is hidden only on the 'md' breakpoint
</p>
```

### Showing by screen width

- `.show-only-*` - hides an element by default, then displays it as `block` only for the specififed breakpoint
- `.show-only-*--i` - hides an element by default, then displays it as `inline` only for the specififed breakpoint
- `.show-only-*--ib` - hides an element by default, then displays it as `inline-block` only for the specififed breakpoint
- `.show-from-*` - hides on element by defaults, then displays it as `block` from the specified breakpoint and up
- `.show-from-*--i` - hides on element by defaults, then displays it as `inline` from the specified breakpoint and up
- `.show-from-*--ib` - hides on element by defaults, then displays it as `inline-block` from the specified breakpoint and up
- `.show-until-*` - hides an element above the specified breakpoint

```
<p class="show-until-md">
    This is visible up until 'md' breakpoint
</p>
<p class="show-from-md--ib">
    This is only visible from the 'md' breakpoint, and is inline-block
</p>
<p class="show-only-md--i">
    <br/>This is visible only on the 'md' breakpoint, as inline
</p>
```

## Accessibility

### Hide visually

Use `.visually-hidden` to show for screenreaders, but hide visually.
Useful for extra explanations to screenreaders to give context.

### Hide from screenreaders

Use `aria-hidden="true"` to hide content from screenreaders but show it visually.
Useful for purely visual elements (e.g. icons) that don't have any meaningful, semantic content.

### Show on focus

Use `.show-on-focus` to create elements that appear visually only when focussed. Useful for skiplinks.

## Print

Use the following classes to show things only for print:

- `.show-print`
- `.show-print--i`
- `.show-print--ib`

Or alternatively use `.hide-print` to hide elements from displaying on print.
