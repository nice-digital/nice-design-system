Its goal is to create a consistent, accessible digital experience across all of NICE's services.

It's a source for creating beautiful, consistent experiences across NICE's digital services. It's aimed at developers, designers and content editors and consists of:

- A base framework to give the structure of a modern web app e.g. grid, typography etc
- A pattern library of both micro and macro patterns
- A style guide for both design and code
- A set of auto-generated documentation at a code-level for both SASS and JavaScript.

It is a re-work of NICE's original adaptation of Bootstrap, known as [NICE.Bootstrap](https://github.com/nhsevidence/NICE.Bootstrap){:target="_blank"}.

<h2>Our aims and principles</h2>

<ul className="grid">
    <li data-g="12 sm:6 md:4 lg:3">
        <h3 className="h6">Tested and testable</h3>
        <p>
            JavaScript written in a testable way with unit tests. Responsive testing. Set of manual accessibility tests.
        </p>
    </li>
    <li data-g="12 sm:6 md:4 lg:3">
        <h3 className="h6">Tooling doesn’t in the way of the code</h3>
        <p>
            It's all about the code so using different IDEs or platforms for dev shouldn't get in the way of building things.
        </p>
    </li>
    <li data-g="12 sm:6 md:4 lg:3">
        <h3 className="h6">Easy to maintain and extend</h3>
        <p>
            It should be a living thing that gets improved and extended so it's got to be easy for developers to pick up and work on.
        </p>
    </li>
    <li data-g="12 sm:6 md:4 lg:3">
        <h3 className="h6">Easy to use and consume</h3>
        <p>
            It should be easy to integrate the NICE Design System into any application with just a few commands, for example via NPM, Bower, or Meteor's Atmosphere.
        </p>
    </li>
    <li data-g="12 sm:6 md:4 lg:3">
        <h3 className="h6">Accessible</h3>
        <p>
            We aim to conform to <a href="https://www.nice.org.uk/accessibility" target="_blank" rel="noopener external">WCAG 2.0 Level AA</a> and follow the <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/UNDERSTANDING-WCAG20/intro.html#introduction-fourprincs-head" target="_blank" rel="noopener external">4 principles of accessibility</a> of perceivable, operable, understandable, and robust for our content.
        </p>
    </li>
    <li data-g="12 sm:6 md:4 lg:3">
        <h3 className="h6">Modern</h3>
        <p>
            But not just modern for the sake of being modern. There are some amazing modern web technologies that we use to try and make great experiences.
        </p>
    </li>
    <li data-g="12 sm:6 md:4 lg:3">
        <h3 className="h6">Modular</h3>
        <p>
            You shouldn't be forced to include everything - pick and choose exactly what you need which means lightweight&hellip;
        </p>
    </li>
    <li data-g="12 sm:6 md:4 lg:3">
        <h3 className="h6">Lightweight</h3>
        <p>
            It's not a monolithic framework with every design pattern NICE have ever used - it's lightweight 'starter for 10' that gives just enough of a framework and as a result is lightweight and quick loading.
        </p>
    </li>
</ul>
