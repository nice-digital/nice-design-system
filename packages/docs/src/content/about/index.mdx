Its goal is to create a consistent, accessible digital experience across all of NICE's services.

It's a source for creating beautiful, consistent experiences across NICE's digital services. It's aimed at developers, designers and content editors and consists of:

- A base framework to give the structure of a modern web app e.g. grid, typography etc
- A pattern library of both micro and macro patterns
- A style guide for both design and code
- A set of auto-generated documentation at a code-level for both SASS and JavaScript.

It is a re-work of NICE's original adaptation of Bootstrap, known as [NICE.Bootstrap](https://github.com/nhsevidence/NICE.Bootstrap).

<h2>Our aims and principles</h2>
<ul className="grid">
	<li data-g="12 sm:6 md:4 lg:3">
		<h3 className="h6">Tested and testable</h3>
		<p>
			JavaScript written in a testable way with unit tests. Responsive testing.
			Set of manual accessibility tests.
		</p>
	</li>
	<li data-g="12 sm:6 md:4 lg:3">
		<h3 className="h6">Tooling doesnâ€™t in the way of the code</h3>
		<p>
			It's all about the code so using different IDEs or platforms for dev
			shouldn't get in the way of building things.
		</p>
	</li>
	<li data-g="12 sm:6 md:4 lg:3">
		<h3 className="h6">Easy to maintain and extend</h3>
		<p>
			It should be a living thing that gets improved and extended so it's got to
			be easy for developers to pick up and work on.
		</p>
	</li>
	<li data-g="12 sm:6 md:4 lg:3">
		<h3 className="h6">Easy to use and consume</h3>
		<p>
			It should be easy to integrate the NICE Design System into any application
			with just a few commands, for example via NPM, Bower, or Meteor's
			Atmosphere.
		</p>
	</li>
	<li data-g="12 sm:6 md:4 lg:3">
		<h3 className="h6">Accessible</h3>
		<p>
			We aim to conform to{" "}
			<a
				href="https://www.nice.org.uk/accessibility"
				target="_blank"
				rel="noopener external"
			>
				WCAG 2.0 Level AA
			</a>{" "}
			and follow the{" "}

			of perceivable, operable, understandable, and robust for our content.
		</p>
	</li>
	<li data-g="12 sm:6 md:4 lg:3">
		<h3 className="h6">Modern</h3>
		<p>
			But not just modern for the sake of being modern. There are some amazing
			modern web technologies that we use to try and make great experiences.
		</p>
	</li>
	<li data-g="12 sm:6 md:4 lg:3">
		<h3 className="h6">Modular</h3>
		<p>
			You shouldn't be forced to include everything - pick and choose exactly
			what you need which means lightweight&hellip;
		</p>
	</li>
	<li data-g="12 sm:6 md:4 lg:3">
		<h3 className="h6">Lightweight</h3>
		<p>
			It's not a monolithic framework with every design pattern NICE have ever
			used - it's lightweight 'starter for 10' that gives just enough of a
			framework and as a result is lightweight and quick loading.
		</p>
	</li>
</ul>
