There may be eye symptoms (ocular rosacea), which are usually bilateral. \u0026#10;Acne rosacea can be classified into four types (erythematotelangiectatic, papulopustular, phymatous, and ocular) and one variant (granulomatous) of the condition. Change from one type to another is possible and a person may have symptoms of more than one type. \u0026#10;Typically, it first presents between the ages of 30â€“50 years in people who are fair-skinned. Although it is more common in women, it tends to be more severe in men. \u0026#10;Possible triggers include extremes of temperature, sunlight, strenuous exercise, stress, spicy foods, alcohol, and hot drinks. Triggers should be avoided where possible.  \u0026#10;Complications include psychosocial problems (including depression in severe cases), ocular conditions (such as blepharitis, conjunctivitis, meibomian cyst, or keratitis), or rosacea fulminans (a severe form of acne rosacea). Diagnosis is usually made on the basis of one or more clinical features, typically affecting the convexities of the central face, and include: Flushing or transient erythema (pre-rosacea). Persistent erythema (erythematotelangiectatic rosacea). Telangiectasia (erythematotelangiectatic rosacea). Papules and pustules (papulopustular rosacea). Phymatous changes (phymatous rosacea), most commonly rhinophyma. Ocular symptoms (ocular rosacea), such as red, gritty, dry or irritated eyes, and the person may describe a foreign body sensation in the eyes.  Additional features such as burning, dry skin, oedema, and plaques may be present. Alternative conditions that present similarly to acne rosacea should be excluded (such as acne vulgaris, seborrhoeic dermatitis, and contact dermatitis). Management of acne rosacea is largely guided by the type and severity of symptoms: Initial management includes lifestyle advice (such as avoidance of triggers), medication review (some drugs can aggravate acne rosacea), and management of any psychosocial problems. For mild or moderate papulopustular rosacea, treatment options include topical metronidazole or topical azelaic acid. For moderate to severe papulopustular rosacea, an oral tetracycline or erythromycin is recommended. Brimonidine 0.5% gel is an option if erythema (without prominent telangiectasia) is the predominant symptom and lifestyle changes are ineffective. Persistent flushing and telangiectasia that does not respond to lifestyle advice, should be referred to a dermatologist. People with prominent rhinophyma should be referred to a plastic surgeon. Ocular rosacea is usually treated with a combination of eyelid hygiene measures, ocular lubricants (for dry eye symptoms), and oral tetracyclines (if symptoms are moderate to severe). People with symptoms of keratitis (such as eye pain, blurred vision, or sensitivity to light) should be referred urgently to an ophthalmologist. People with ocular symptoms that are resistant to optimal treatment in primary care should be referred routinely to an ophthalmologist. People should be advised to return if symptoms worsen despite lifestyle changes or drug treatment. Follow up should be arranged after 6-12 weeks to assess effectiveness of the treatment and determine future management.\",\"feedertype\":\"pfeeders\",\"published_date\":\"2018-10-01T12:00:00\",\"source_name\":\"CKS\"},\"highlight\":{\"title\":[\"Rosacea - \u003cb\u003eacne\u003c/b\u003e\"],\"content\":[\"Rosacea - \u003cmark\u003eacne\u003c/mark\u003e\\r\\n    \\r\\n    \\r\\n    Last revised in October 2018\\r\\n        Next planned review by December 2021 \\r\\n\\t\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n    \\r\\n        Summary\\r\\n        Back\",\"Back to top Rosacea - \u003cmark\u003eacne\u003c/mark\u003e: Summary \\r\\n    \\r\\n    \\n\u003cmark\u003eAcne\u003c/mark\u003e rosacea is a chronic relapsing skin condition affecting the face, characterized by recurrent episodes\",\"There may be eye symptoms (ocular rosacea), which are usually bilateral. \\n\u003cmark\u003eAcne\u003c/mark\u003e rosacea can be classified into four types (erythematotelangiectatic, papulopustular\",\"conjunctivitis, meibomian cyst, or keratitis), or rosacea fulminans (a severe form of \u003cmark\u003eacne\u003c/mark\u003e rosacea).

It presents with lesions which can be non-inflammatory (comedones), inflammatory (papules, pustules and nodules) or a mixture of both. Up to 95% of adolescents in Western industrialized countries are affected by acne to some extent \u0026mdash; 20 to 35% develop moderate or severe acne. Complications of acne include skin changes such as scarring, post-inflammatory hyperpigmentation or depigmentation and psychosocial problems such as depression and anxiety. All people with acne should be advised:To avoid over cleaning the skin (which may cause dryness and irritation) - acne is not caused by poor hygiene. To use non-comedogenic make-up, cleansers and/or emollients with a pH close to the skin if needed. To avoid picking and squeezing spots which may increase the risk of scarring. That acne treatments are effective but take time to work - usually up to 8 weeks. That acne treatments may irritate the skin, especially at the start of treatment - concentration or application frequency may need to be reduced if skin irritation occurs.   In mild acne where open and closed comedones (blackheads and whiteheads) predominate:A single topical treatment such as a topical retinoid (for example adapalene, if not contraindicated) or benzoyl peroxide should be considered as first-line treatment. If both topical retinoids and benzoyl peroxide are poorly tolerated, azelaic acid can be considered.   In moderate acne where inflammatory lesions (papules and pustules) predominate and response to topical preparations alone is inadequate:Addition of an oral antibiotic such as lymecycline or doxycycline (for a maximum of 3 months) can be considered.A topical retinoid (if not contraindicated) or benzoyl peroxide should always be co-prescribed with oral antibiotics to reduce the risk of antibiotic resistance. Macrolide antibiotics (such as erythromycin) should generally be avoided due to high levels of P. acnes resistance but can be used if tetracyclines are contraindicated (for example in pregnancy). Non-response to two different courses of antibiotics, or scarring are indications for referral to dermatology for consideration of treatment with isotretinoin.   Combined oral contraceptives (if not contraindicated) in combination with topical agents can be considered as an alternative to systemic antibiotics in women \u0026ndash; prescription should be guided by the UK Medical Eligibility Criteria for Contraceptive Use.

Significant psychological distress is associated with acne, regardless of severity. There is diagnostic uncertainty.   Follow-up should be arranged 8-12 weeks after initiation of each treatment step:If there has been an adequate response, treatment should be continued for at least 12 weeks. If acne has cleared or almost cleared, maintenance therapy with topical retinoids (if not contraindicated) or azelaic acid should be considered.

Referral for\u0026nbsp;ultrasound scan is required in adult women (unless the diagnosis of PCOS is obvious on clinical and biochemical ground).\u0026nbsp;Ultrasound scan should not be used for the diagnosis of PCOS in adolescents due to the high incidence of multi-follicular ovaries in this life stage.   In adults, PCOS should be diagnosed if two out of three of the following criteria are present, provided other causes of menstrual disturbance and hyperandrogenism have been excluded:Clinical and/or biochemical signs of hyperandrogenism. Oligo-anovulation or anovulation. Polycystic ovaries, defined as\u0026nbsp;the presence of 12 or more follicles (measuring 2\u0026ndash;9\u0026nbsp;mm in diameter) in one or both ovaries and/or increased ovarian volume (more than 10 cm3 ).   When diagnosing PCOS in adolescents, tighter criteria requiring both hyperandrogenism and irregular menstrual cycles is\u0026nbsp;recommended\u0026nbsp;due to the overlap with normal pubertal reproductive physiology.\u0026nbsp; Management of PCOS includes:Advising on a healthy lifestyle and measures to reduce cardiovascular risk.\u0026nbsp;Where appropriate, weight loss should be advised.

Local corticosteroids are predominantly glucocorticoids. They have 4 main effects:Anti-inflammatory. Immunosuppressive. Anti-proliferative (anti-mitotic). Vasoconstrictive.   Topical corticosteroids exert these effects on the skin:Eczema â€” the anti-inflammatory and immunosuppressive effects are important. Psoriasis â€” is characterized by rapid cell turnover, and the anti-mitotic effects are important.   Intranasal corticosteroids exert these effects on the nasal mucosa.They relieve or prevent the symptoms associated with allergic rhinitis. They can also be used in the short-term to shrink nasal polyps.   Corticosteroid eye preparations control inflammation of the eye due to allergy, trauma, or infection. The length of treatment with topical corticosteroids depends on the diagnosis.Generally, very potent corticosteroids should not be used for more than 3 weeks continuously. If treatment is indicated for longer, intermittent dosing and gradual tapering of the dose should be considered, and more frequent monitoring for adverse effects should be arranged. Less potent topical corticosteroids can be used for up to 3 months, except in intertriginous areas, on the face and neck, or under occlusion. Abrupt withdrawal of topical corticosteroids can cause a relapse or rebound of the condition being treated (for example psoriasis or eczema).   Topical corticosteroids should be avoided in people with bacterial, fungal, or viral skin lesions; acne rosacea; perioral dermatitis; acne vulgaris; or skin ulceration, and they should not be used indiscriminately for the treatment of itch. Local adverse effects of topical corticosteroids occur mostly on the face, in skin folds, and in areas that are treated long-term. Adverse effects include:Transient burning or stinging. Thinning of the skin. Permanent striae. Acne vulgaris (or worsening of existing acne) or acne rosacea.   Intranasal corticosteroids:Are more likely to cause systemic adverse effects when delivered by intranasal drops compared with sprays. Should not be used in the presence of untreated nasal infections; after nasal surgery before healing has occurred, unless on specialist advice; or if there is pulmonary tuberculosis.   About 10% of people develop local adverse effects from intranasal corticosteroids, including dryness, irritation, and nosebleeds. If adverse effects are severe, this may require stopping treatment temporarily. Skin erythema and rash, itching, headache, and disturbance of smell and taste may also occur. Corticosteroid eye preparations:Should always be initiated in secondary care. Treatment may be continued and monitored in primary care following a specialist management plan. May cause increased intraocular pressure in about 30% of people, leading to corticosteroid-induced glaucoma. May cause corticosteroid-induced cataract if use is prolonged. Should not be used with soft contact lenses â€” lenses should be removed before instillation of drops, and not worn during the period of treatment.\",\"feedertype\":\"pfeeders\",\"published_date\":\"2018-11-01T12:00:00\",\"source_name\":\"CKS\"},\"highlight\":{\"content\":[\"in people with bacterial, fungal, or viral skin lesions; \u003cmark\u003eacne\u003c/mark\u003e rosacea; perioral dermatitis; \u003cmark\u003eacne\u003c/mark\u003e vulgaris; or skin ulceration, and they should not be used\",\"stinging.

To diagnose PMS, a detailed history should be taken, a\u0026nbsp;physical examination should be performed as indicated by the woman\u0026#39;s age and routine gynaecological and medical recommendations, and the woman should be asked to\u0026nbsp;record a daily symptom diary\u0026nbsp;for two or three cycles.

The progestogen-only method of contraception includes the progestogen-only pill (POP), the progestogen-only implant, and the progestogen-only injectable.\u0026nbsp; POPs contain either levonorgestrel, norethisterone, or desogestrel and should be taken daily at the same time each day for 28 days, with no pill-free interval. POPs work by thickening cervical mucus, delaying ovum transport, inhibiting ovulation, and providing an endometrium hostile to implantation.Suppression of ovulation occurs in varying degrees \u0026mdash; 97% in women taking desogestrel and about 60% in woman taking levonorgestrel (Norgeston\u0026reg;). POPs prevent conception (even when ovulation is not suppressed) through various combinations of these mechanisms, with great inter-individual and intra-individual variation.
