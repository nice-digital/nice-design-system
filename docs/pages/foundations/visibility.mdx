};

## Showing and hiding

Use the following selectors for visibility:

-   `.show` and `.hide` to toggle between `display:block` and `display:none`
-   or `.show--i` or `.show--ib` for inline/inline-block respectively
-   use `.invisible` and `.visible` to toggle between visibility hidden/visible

Also, see the accessibility section for showing/hiding content for screenreaders

## Orientation

Use the following classes for visibility on different orientations:

-   `.show-landscape`
-   `.hide-landscape`
-   `.show-portrait`
-   `.hide-portrait`

<Example>
<h3>Example: orientation</h3>
<Orientation />

```html
<p class="show-landscape">This is visible only on landscape orientations</p>
<p class="show-portrait">This is visible only on portrait orientations</p>
```
</Example>

## Responsive helpers

Use the following classes to manage visibility across breakpoints. If you're writing a custom component, consider using media queries to achieve this rather than using these classes.

## Hiding by screen width

-   `.hide-only-*` - hides an element for the specified breakpoint only
-   `.hide-from-*` - hides for the specified breakpoint and above
-   `.hide-until-*` - hides from 0px wide up until the breakpoint, and displays it as `block` above
-   `.hide-until-*--i` - hides from 0px wide up until the breakpoint, and displays it as `inline` above
-   `.hide-until-*--ib` - hides from 0px wide up until the breakpoint, and displays it as `inline-block`> above

<Example>
<h3>Example: hiding by screen width</h3>
<HideByScreenWidth />

```html
<p class="hide-until-md">This is hidden until the md breakpoint and up</p>
<p class="hide-from-md">This is hidden from the md breakpoint and up</p>
<p class="hide-only-md">This is hidden only in the md breakpoint</p>
```
</Example>

## Showing by screen width

-   `.show-only-*` - hides an element by default, then displays it as `block` only for the specififed breakpoint
-   `.show-only-*--i` - hides an element by default, then displays it as `inline` only for the specififed breakpoint
-   `.show-only-*--ib` - hides an element by default, then displays it as `inline-block` only for the specififed breakpoint
-   `.show-from-*` - hides on element by defaults, then displays it as `block` from the specified breakpoint and up
-   `.show-from-*--i` - hides on element by defaults, then displays it as `inline` from the specified breakpoint and up
-   `.show-from-*--ib` - hides on element by defaults, then displays it as `inline-block` from the specified breakpoint and up
-   `.show-until-*` - hides an element above the specified breakpoint

<Example>
<h3>Example: showing by screen width</h3>
<ShowByScreenWidth />

```html
<p class="show-until-md">This is visible until the md breakpoint</p>
<p class="show-from-md">This is visible from the md breakpoint and up</p>
<p class="show-only-md">This is visible only in the md breakpoint</p>
```
</Example>

## Hide visually

Use `.visually-hidden` to show for screenreaders, but hide visually. Useful for extra explanations to screenreaders to give context.

## Hide from screenreaders

Use `aria-hidden="true"` to hide content from screenreaders but show it visually. Useful for purely visual elements (e.g. icons) that donâ€™t have any meaningful, semantic content.

## Show on focus

Use `.show-on-focus` to create elements that appear visually only when focussed. Useful for skiplinks.

## Print

Use the following classes to show things only for print:

-   `.show-print`
-   `.show-print--i`
-   `.show-print--ib`


Or alternatively use `.hide-print` to hide elements from displaying on print.

## Accessibility

Component meets WCAG AA guidelines for accessibility on:

- Text contrast - Text has a contrast ratio of at least 4.5:1 for small text and at least 3:1 for large text (WCAG 2.0 )1.4.3).
- UI contrast - Visual information required to identify components and states (except inactive components) has a contrast ratio of at least 3:1 (WCAG 2.1 1.4.11).
- Accessible use of colour - Colour is not used as the only visual means of conveying information (WCAG 2.0 1.4.1).

## Research and evidence

No research done on the component at this time.
