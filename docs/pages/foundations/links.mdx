## When to use

Their primary usage is to link to other pages or content.

## When not to use

Don't use links instead of buttons. Buttons should be the default component for triggering an action.

## How to use

### Basics

Links are blue and underlined by default.

-   links should follow the same sizing as containing copy
-   use rel="noopener external", rel="noopener", rel="next" and rel="prev" and [other link types](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Link_types) where applicable
-   use `@include links-default` in SASS to force link styles

### Content guidelines

Links without surrounding text should not have a full stop at the end.

If your link is at the end of a sentence, make sure that the linked text does not include the full stop.

The wording of links is important. Make links contextual and meaningful. Screen readers read out links as a list, so link text needs to be descriptive.

#### Do:

-   Write link text that makes the destination and purpose of the link clear.
-   Write out email and phone links.
-   Avoid making links too long.

#### Don't:

-   use the same link text for different URLs on the same page.
-   write vague link text such as 'click here' and 'Read more' which don't tell the user where the link will take them/what it will do.

### Links on dark backgrounds

Use inverse links when they sit on a dark background. Components with dark background have inverse links built in, for example [inverse panels](https://nice-digital.github.io/nice-design-system/components/panel/#inverse-dark-panel).

-   Use `.link--inverse` on an individual link
-   or use `.inverse-links` on a containing element
-   use `@include links-inverse` in SASS on custom dark background components.

### Opening links in a new tab

Avoid opening links in a new tab or window. It can be disorienting - and can cause [accessibility problems for people who cannot visually perceive that the new tab has opened](https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG20-TECHS/G200.html).

### Links without underlines

If the context tells the user that the text is a link, even without the underline then you can leave them off.

For example, links in side navigation don't need underlines. Users will understand that they're links because of where they are, at the same place, across different pages.

<Screenshot image="links-1.png" alt="Screenshot of the links within the stacked nav component" caption="Example of stacked navigation component - no underlines on links." />

## Accessibility

Ensure links are written so they can be understood by users of assistive technologies such as screen readers.

Component meets WCAG AA guidelines for accessibility on:

- Text contrast - Text has a contrast ratio of at least 4.5:1 for small text and at least 3:1 for large text (WCAG 2.0 )1.4.3).
- UI contrast - Visual information required to identify components and states (except inactive components) has a contrast ratio of at least 3:1 (WCAG 2.1 1.4.11).
- Accessible use of colour - Colour is not used as the only visual means of conveying information (WCAG 2.0 1.4.1).

## Research/evidence

No research done on the table component at this time.

export default ({ children }) => <ComponentLayout meta={meta} type="foundations">{children}</ComponentLayout>;
