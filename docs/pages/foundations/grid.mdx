## Usage
### Page width


The default maximum page width is 1170px (73.125rem), but go wider if the content requires it.

Use a grid to lay out your content.

Text has a maximum character limit of 66 characters to prevent long lines of text. Text will wrap regardless of the grid span it sits in.

## Screen size

Design for small screens first using a single column layout.

Optimise for different screen sizes, but don't make assumptions about specific devices.

See our [responsive guidelines](https://nice-digital.github.io/nice-design-system/foundations/responsive/) for further content on building mobile first responsive layouts.

## Layout considerations

-   Know and understand how the information on the page will be used

-   organise content in terms of priority and group related content together

-   always consider how your layout will be shown on small screen devices

-   only exceed the maximum container width when your content requires it

-   keep the layout consistent when developing similar pages.


## Containers

-   Containers have a maximum width (1170px or 73.125rem) and are centrally aligned horizontally

-   use the `--full` modifier to fill the available screen width when your content requires it

-   extend it in SASS via the `%container` placeholder for building custom components

-   don't nest containers

-   add vertical [spacing classes](https://nice-digital.github.io/nice-design-system/foundations/spacing/#css-classes) to containers to add margins and padding.


## Grid system

We use a grid to structure our designs. Our grid is a mobile-first, responsive, fluid system based on a 12 column layout:

-   wrap grids in a `.container` to take care of maximum width and fluidity

-   grids fill the available space within their parent container

-   the grid is based on a fluid, responsive 12 column grid

-   [grid items](https://nice-digital.github.io/nice-design-system/foundations/layout/#grid-items) sit directly within grids

-   use `.grid` for grids and `data-g` for grid items

-   grids can be nested within infinitely nested

-   use [mixins](https://nice-digital.github.io/nice-design-system/foundations/layout/#semantic) for generating layouts or components with semantic class names.


## Grid items

Use the `data-g` attribute to create grid items:

-   specify how many of the 12 columns to span, e.g. `data-g="3"` or `data-g="one-quarter" `for spanning three of the twelve columns

-   there are also more human readable names like _one-half_, _two-thirds_, _three-quarters_ etc, eg. `data-g="two-thirds"`

-   use `breakpoint:columns` to override the column width from a breakpoint e.g. `data-g="6 md:3"` or `data-g="12 md:one-third"`

-   grid item widths are mobile-first

-   if there are more than 12 items within a grid, the items simply wrap onto the next line.

## Responsive grids

-   grids are mobile first

-   use `xs:`, `sm:`, `md:`, `lg:` and `xl:` for different screen size

-   use our [breakpoints](https://nice-digital.github.io/nice-design-system/foundations/responsive/#breakpoints).

## Other grid features

Use [BEM modifiers](https://nice-digital.github.io/nice-design-system/technical/sass/code-standards/#bem-and-naming) for grids features. Use grid features when needed to suit the presentation of content.

## Reversed

The `.grid--rev` modifier renders the grid it in the opposite order to the source order. This is useful for stacking things in the correct order on mobile devices.

## Gutterlesss

Remove the gutter between grid items with the `.grid--gutterless` modifier. Generally used for small components nested within other grids, or when you need to closely relate two pieces of information.

## Compact

Use smaller gutters between grid items with the `.grid--compact` modifier.

## Loose

Use larger gutters between grid items with the `.grid--loose` modifier. A loose grid is generally used for layouts and container components.

## Semantic

Use grid mixins for creating semantic class names for grid-based layouts. This replaces the default grid
