## What you do

### 1. Check the NICE Design System and GitHub discussions.

What problem are you looking to solve? Check to see if anything already exists in the NICE design system that could solve it. The contents of the NICE design system are regularly reviewed to ensure they are useful, usable and adhere to best practise.

### 2. Desk research

If you cannot find a solution in the design system, look at how other organisations address this problem. Look at other websites and consider existing methods, best practice, and evidence. This is called [desk research](https://www.nngroup.com/articles/secondary-research-in-ux/).

### 3. Submit your proposal

<Link className="btn" href="/community/requesting-a-component/">Request a component or pattern</Link>

The <Link href="/community/component-criteria/">component criteria</Link> will help you understand what we look for in a proposal.

## What we do

### 4. Review proposal

The design system team will set up a meeting with you to discuss and review the proposal.

We will check to see if a similar proposal has already been made. The team will decide if the proposal is suitable for the NICE design system.

### 5. User research and design

User experience designers will develop initial prototypes for the component by collaborating with content designers and developers using real content where possible.

The designs will be critiqued by the team to generate assumptions and hypotheses for user research. The team will use the decision and actions log to record next steps.

User research will be carried out to generate more evidence to ensure the proposal meets user's needs.

### 6. Development and technical testing

Developers will write and review the component code by pairing with other developers and technical testers. They use acceptance criteria, which includes accessibility testing.

They will also discuss and review the component with you.

### 7. Publish

The design system team will collaborate on completing component documentation using the component checklist as a guide.

The component will be published into the NICE design system and used where necessary.

### 8. Share

The design system team will give updates on what's changed at the NICE design system show and tell.

Updates will also be posted on the <Link href="/">Design System homepage</Link>, on [GitHub](https://github.com/nice-digital/nice-design-system) and via our [Teams channel](https://teams.microsoft.com/l/team/19%3aj3x65ql6djS-Ro2mM8yQIRzK_QHOk1S3Jl75got7hwk1%40thread.tacv2/conversations?groupId=10c92ff2-b41f-42d1-abef-f34f5bfe1202&tenantId=6030f479-b342-472d-a5dd-740ff7538de9).
