To ensure that the contents in the NICE design system are of high quality they need to meet a certain standard.

## What we look for in a proposal

The design system team will review whether a proposal is unique and useful.

### Unique

The component/pattern/other does not already exist in the NICE Design System.

If the proposal is a change to an existing component or pattern, then it should be an improvement on what we currently have.

### Useful

There is evidence the component or pattern meets user or business needs.

## Developing a component or pattern

During development, a component or pattern will be assessed against these criteria to ensure it is suitable to be published into the NICE design system.

### Usable

User research shows the component/pattern is easy to use or solves a usability issue(s).

### Impactful

The component or pattern can add value to the organisation.

### Versatile

The component or pattern can be used for multiple NICE services and products.

### Consistent

Existing styles/foundations can be used to design and develop the component or pattern.

### Feasible

It is technically feasible for the component to be developed in an accessible way to ensure we develop components everybody can use.
