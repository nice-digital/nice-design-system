## When to use

The Horizontal navigation allows users to see at a glance what navigation options are available. It is best used in situations where:

-   Maximum amount of space is needed for content.
-   Primary and secondary navigation needed.

### Maximum amount of space is needed for content

Horizontal navigation sits **above** the content. This means the whole width of the page is available for content underneath. This compares to the stacked navigation component which sits alongside content and takes up a portion of the content area.

### Primary and secondary navigation needed

Horizontal navigation is useful to use as a primary navigation component, sitting above content that also needs secondary navigation. The Horizontal nav sits above content which implies a higher position in the content hierarchy,

## When not to use

Don't use when:

-   There are lots of links in the navigation
-   There are long navigations links
-   The menu structure could grow in future beyond the width of the screen.

Horizontal navigation is limited by the amount of space across the screen. For this reason it doesn't work as well in situations where the navigation items take up lots of horizontal space or the navigation isn't clearly defined and could grow in future.

### Don't use when you should use tabs

Use tabs to switch between related content on the same page. Horizontal navigation should be used to move between different pages of content.

> **Use tabs to alternate between views within the same context**, not to navigate to different areas. This is the single most important point, because staying in place while alternating views is the reason we have tabs in the first place.

## How to use

### Positioning

<Screenshot image="horizontal-nav-1.png" alt="Screenshot of the horizontal nav component" />

The Horizontal navigation should appear above the content it relates to.

### Content

Avoid long link text. Link text should be as simple as possible, one or two words.

Use 5-6 links maximum. On desktop the Horizontal navigation shouldn't be wider than the screen width.

### Ordering of links

Links should be ordered left-right in order of importance/usefulness. Most useful link first/left, least useful last/right.

## Accessibility

Link text should be descriptive - it should explain where the user will be taken to.

Tap targets meet minimum size requirements (44 x 44 px).

Component meets WCAG AA guidelines for accessibility on:

- Text contrast - Text has a contrast ratio of at least 4.5:1 for small text and at least 3:1 for large text (WCAG 2.0 )1.4.3).
- UI contrast - Visual information required to identify components and states (except inactive components) has a contrast ratio of at least 3:1 (WCAG 2.1 1.4.11).
- Accessible use of colour - Colour is not used as the only visual means of conveying information (WCAG 2.0 1.4.1).

## Research/evidence

We conducted click tests to sense check the pattern made sense to users.

Users were given a task to navigate to content in a design featuring the Horizontal navigation.

7/10 users clicked the correct navigation element with the first click.

export default ({ children }) => <ComponentLayout meta={meta}>{children}</ComponentLayout>;
