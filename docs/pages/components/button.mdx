## Introduction

Buttons are large clickable elements that make it clear to users what actions can be taken on a page.  There are 4 styles of buttons available to use:

- Call to action (CTA)
- Primary
- Secondary
- Inverse

## When to use

Buttons are used to trigger an action on a page - for example apply a filter, run a search query or move to another page through a link.

## When not to use

Don't use buttons for links inside headings, paragraphs or blocks of text.

## How to use

### Content guidelines

Buttons should clearly describe what action the user takes when they click it. Examples include:

- Download guidance
- Filter results
- Sign out

Use sentence case - only capitalise the first letter. For example 'Filter results' not 'Filter Results'.

Button text needs to make sense on its own; avoid vague text such as 'More' or 'Click here'.

### Button basics

- Use the correct semantics for the button element - buttons can be `<a>` for links, `<button>` for actions or `<input type="submit">` for form submissions.
- Ensure that prominent buttons are displayed in a easy to spot location.
- Place buttons in a sensible order.
- Make it harder to find destructive buttons (e.g. Cancel, Delete).

### Call to action (CTA) button

<Example>
<h4>Example: CTA button</h4>
<CTAButton />

<CH.Code>
```js React
<Button variant={Button.variants.cta}>CTA button</Button>
```
```html HTML
<button type="button" class="btn" data-component="button--cta">CTA button</button>
```
</CH.Code>
</Example>

Used for the main call to action on a page. Don't use more than one CTA button on a page. Having more than one main call to action reduces their impact, and makes it harder for users to know what to do next.

The CTA button is for actions that are a clear priority on the page - form submissions,
primary navigation links. Think about the action in relation to the overall goal
of the page. Some actions are important but not the main focus of the page and
so the secondary button might be more appropriate.

### Primary button

<Example>
<h4>Example: primary button</h4>
<PrimaryButton />

<CH.Code>
```js React
<Button variant={Button.variants.primary}>Primary button</Button>
```
```html HTML
<button type="button" class="btn" data-component="button--primary">Primary button</button>
```
</CH.Code>
</Example>

For actions that need less prominence than a CTA button. Examples include:

- A secondary action on a page following a CTA button.
- A page with two actions of equal importance, where it would be inappropriate to give extra emphasis to one action with a CTA button.
- Where a CTA button would distract from the main goal or content of the page.

<Screenshot image="button-1.png" alt="Screenshot of the NICE guidance page" caption="Filtering results isn't the main purpose of this page. A primary button could distract from the main content list and so wouldn't be appropriate to use even though it's main button on the page." />

### Secondary button

<Example>
<h4>Example: secondary button</h4>
<SecondaryButton />

<CH.Code>
```js React
<Button variant={Button.variants.secondary}>Secondary button</Button>
```
```html HTML
<button type="button" class="btn" data-component="button--secondary">Secondary button</button>
```
</CH.Code>
</Example>

For actions that need less prominence than a primary button. Examples include:

- A secondary action on a page following a primary button.
- A page with two actions of equal importance, where it would be inappropriate to give extra emphasis to one action with a Primary button.
- Where a primary button would distract from the main goal or content of the page.

### Inverse button

<Example>
<h4>Example: inverse button</h4>
<InverseButton />

<CH.Code>
```js React
<Button variant={Button.variants.inverse}>Inverse button</Button>
```
```html HTML
<button type="button" class="btn" data-component="button--inverse">Inverse button</button>
```
</CH.Code>
</Example>

To be used as an alternative option on dark backgrounds where other button colours won't give sufficient contrast. UI elements (Buttons) should have a 3:1 contrast ratio to the surrounding background colour. You can use a contrast checker to check values:

<Screenshot image="button-2.png" alt="Screenshot of a button with insufficient contrast" caption="The primary button doesn't pass contrast ratios on the alert banner" />
<Screenshot image="button-3.png" alt="Screenshot of the inverse button in use" caption="The inverse button is used instead" />

## Accessibility

Write descriptive button text that describes what the button will do. Button text needs to make sense on it's own when read by assistive technology such as a screen reader. Use visually hidden text to add context for assistive technologies in cases where this can't be added to the button visually.

### Contrast checks

Component passes AA contrast ratio for text: Yes

Component pass AA contrast ratio for UI elements: Yes

## Research/evidence

We A/B tested variations of the button design and found the design with a shadow and rounded corners performed best. This was implemented in the design.

export default ({ children }) => <ComponentLayout meta={meta}>{children}</ComponentLayout>;
