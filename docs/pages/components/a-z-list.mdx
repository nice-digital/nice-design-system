## Overview

A to Z lists panels group together links associated with a letter of the alphabet. For example, all links starting with the letter A.
They work alongside the alphabet component [link to component] to create A to Z navigation pages [link to pattern]. These pages present a number of links in an alphabetical list so users can find and navigate to the content they need.

## When to use

A to Z list panels should be used when there are a number of links that can be grouped together by different letters.
We currently use the A to Z pattern in these areas of the NICE website:

-   [CKS topic A-Z](https://cks.nice.org.uk/topics/#a)
-   [BNF drugs A-Z](https://bnf.nice.org.uk/drugs/)
-   [BNF Interactions A-Z](https://bnf.nice.org.uk/interactions/)
-   [BNF Treatment summaries A-Z](https://bnf.nice.org.uk/treatment-summaries/)

## When not to use

Do not use the A to Z list panels for links or groups of links that are not split up by letters in alphabetical order.
The column list [link to component] can be used as a generic container for grouping links on a navigation page. It has similar styling to the A to Z list panel but without the letter heading at the top of the container.

## How to use

The panels should sit below the alphabet component.

Links sit in alphabetical order across 3 columns starting with the top left column, Links flow down a column before moving to the next column.
The panels stack down the page in alphabetical order.
If there are no links associated with a letter then the panel isnâ€™t created.

## Accessibility

Component meets WCAG AA guidelines for accessibility on:

- Text contrast - Text has a contrast ratio of at least 4.5:1 for small text and at least 3:1 for large text (WCAG 2.0 1.4.3).
-  UI contrast - Visual information required to identify components and states (except inactive components) has a contrast ratio of at least 3:1 (WCAG 2.1 1.4.11).
Accessible use of color - Color is not used as the only visual means of conveying information (WCAG 2.0 1.4.1).

## Research/evidence

We A/B tested the A to Z list panel in October 2022.

We tested 2 versions of a single column list design against the current 3 column list. We ran the test across 3 different A-Z list pages on the BNF website:
-   Drugs
-   Interactions
-   Treatments summaries.

Overall, the 3 column design performed better for both:

-   the time taken to click a link
-   the click through rate (how many people clicked a link on the page).

However, the single column list performed better on the Treatment summaries A-Z list. Our assumption is because this was a much shorter list.
As a result of the test, the current 3 column list has remained unchanged. We could look to support shorter A-Z lists with a single column variant in future.
