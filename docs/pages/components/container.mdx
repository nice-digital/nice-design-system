## What is it?

A container is an empty `<div>` component that you fill with content. Containers have pre-set margin and width settings that centre content on the page.

Containers help to make the site work across different devices and screen sizes. They keep content centred on the page across large screen sizes by adding a max-width of 73.125rem.

## When to use

All pages should be inside some sort of container element, however some existing templates and site sections such as the Footer, header and global nav have margin and width settings already built in so the container isn’t needed.

Use if you need to make page content align with the fixed website elements such as the global nav and footer.

You should use a container to wrap content inside the full bleed component [link]. Without a container content won’t align with surrounding content.

### Full bleed without a container

### Full bleed with container inside

## When not to use

Don't put a container inside another container.

Some parts of the site, such as the corporate pages of the website, use page templates that have margin and width settings already applied so the container is not needed.

## How to use

### Default container

<Example>
<CH.Code>
```js React
<Container>Content here...</Container>
```
```html HTML
<div class="container">Content here...</div>
```
</CH.Code>
</Example>

### Full width container

<Example>
<CH.Code>
```js React
<Container fullWidth>Full width content here...</Container>
```
```html HTML
<div class="container container--full">Full width content here...</div>
```
</CH.Code>
</Example>

The full width option overrides the default max-width of the container and sets it to 98% of the parent element's width.
