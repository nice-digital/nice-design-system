# {meta.title}

Help users narrow down long lists of information by letting them filter out items that don’t meet their chosen criteria.

## Overview

A summary of the filtered results on a page, which update as you apply filters from the filter panel.

It shows how many results have been returned in total and on that page and allows you to remove filters and sort the returned data.

There are four variations of the alert component:

### Filter summary

<Example>
<h2>Example: filter summary</h2>
<FilterSummary activeFilters={[
		{
			label: "Guidance"
		},
		{
			label: "Pathway"
		}
	]}>
	Showing results 1 to 10 of 1209
</FilterSummary>
</Example>

### Filter panel with filter group

<Example>
A filter panel can contain a filter group with filter options to select
<FilterPanel heading="A filter panel">
	<FilterGroup heading="Type">
		<FilterOption isSelected={true} value="This is an example" onChanged={()=>console.log("bleugh")}>
			This is an example
		</FilterOption>
		<FilterOption isSelected={false} value="Another example" onChanged={()=>console.log("bleugh")}>
			Another example
		</FilterOption>
	</FilterGroup>
</FilterPanel>
</Example>

### Filter panel with filter by input

<Example>
A filter panel can contain a filter group with a filter by input
<FilterPanel heading="A filter panel">
	<FilterByInput label="test" name="test">
	</FilterByInput>
</FilterPanel>
</Example>

### Filter panel with multiple filters

<Example>
// A filter panel can contain a filter group with filter options to select, and/or a filter by input
<FilterPanel heading="A filter panel">
	<FilterGroup heading="Type">
		<FilterOption isSelected={true} value="This is an example" onChanged={()=>console.log("bleugh")}>
			This is an example
		</FilterOption>
		<FilterOption isSelected={false} value="Another example" onChanged={()=>console.log("bleugh")}>
			Another example
		</FilterOption>
	</FilterGroup>
	<FilterByInput label="test" name="test">
	</FilterByInput>
</FilterPanel>
</Example>


## When to use filters

Use filters when providing a long list of results which introduces search filter complexity.

## When not use filters

When it isn't appropriate to present content with filters, they are not required.

## How to use

### Filter summary

This component should be positioned directly above the results.

### Filter panel with a filter group

For the filter group, you can indicate the selected filters.

### Filter panel with filter by input

You can use any standard input; it will default to a text input.

You can use variants on our input components, such as an error message or hint text.

### Filter panel with multiple filters

Avoid lengthy text for the filter options. Option text should be as simple as possible, one or two words.

If you change the text on the filter by the input button, ensure it is clear what that button does.

## Accessibility

Component meets WCAG AA guidelines for accessibility on:

Text contrast - Text has a contrast ratio of at least 4.5:1 for small text and at least 3:1 for large text (WCAG 2.0 )1.4.3).

UI contrast - Visual information required to identify components and states (except inactive components) has a contrast ratio of at least 3:1 (WCAG 2.1 1.4.11).

Accessible use of colour - Colour is not used as the only visual means of conveying information (WCAG 2.0 1.4.1).
