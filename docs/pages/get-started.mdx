Our design system is here to help you design and build services at NICE.

It is a collection of guidelines, design elements and tools that helps you create consistent, accessible and usable digital products.

There are a number of ways you can use the design system or get involved:

## Find and reference design elements

Our current design [components](/design-library/#components) and [foundations](/design-library/#foundations) are documented with guidance and best practice on how to use them, including:

- when and when not to use a component.
- accessibility requirements and best practice.
- any evidence or research behind a component.

## Grab the code

The code for all our design elements is available on the [component](/design-library/#components) and [foundation](/design-library/#foundations) pages.

Use the HTML or React code for building, prototyping or experimenting with.

## Prototyping

There are a few different ways you can prototype new designs and concepts using the Design System.

Our [prototyping](/prototyping) page has all the information you need to create low and high-fidelity prototypes.

## Code and development

View the [GitHub repo](https://github.com/nice-digital/nice-design-system) to learn how to update the system and use components in your code base.

export default ({ children }) => <DefaultLayout meta={meta}>{children}</DefaultLayout>;
