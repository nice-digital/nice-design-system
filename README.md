## What is it?

NICE Design System is a replacement for [NICE.Bootstrap](https://github.com/nice-digital/NICE.Bootstrap/). It's a design system, front-end toolkit and pattern library for rapidly building modern, accessible web apps that are consistent with the NICE brand guidelines.

## Browser support

| IE/Edge | Chrome | Firefox | Safari | Safari (iOS) | Android | 
| ------- | ------ | ------- | ------ | ------------ | ------- |
| ![Internet Explorer](https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/browser-logos/35.2.0/internet-explorer/internet-explorer_48x48.png) | ![Chrome](https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/browser-logos/35.2.0/chrome/chrome_48x48.png) | ![Firefox](https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/browser-logos/35.2.0/firefox/firefox_48x48.png) | ![Safari](https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/browser-logos/35.2.0/safari/safari_48x48.png) | ![Safari (iOS)](https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/browser-logos/35.2.0/safari-ios/safari-ios_48x48.png) | ![Android](https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/browser-logos/35.2.0/android/android_48x48.png) |
| 8+ | 52+ | 47+ | Latest | Latest | Latest |

And all other modern browsers

We support IE8 because of our audience - traffic to nice.org.uk as of 22/09/2016:

- 15.80% - IE11
- 5.08% - IE8
- 2.61% - IE9
- 1.78% - IE10
- 0.56% - IE7

To support older IE we have separate builds of our JS and CSS.

## Accessibility

NICE Design System has been built with accessibility in mind and is built to conform to WCAG 2.0 AA. 

See https://www.nice.org.uk/accessibility for more information on NICE's policy.

## Development

### Getting started

	TL;DR:
		1. `yarn`
		3. `npm start`

To run the dev server and tests on your local machine, first install:

- [Node 6+](https://nodejs.org/en/download/)
- [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/en/docs/install)

Then before you can run any tasks, run the following from the command line to install dependencies:

- `yarn`

> Note: if you prefer to use npm rather than yarn, run `npm i` instead.

We use Grunt as a task runner hence the dependency on Node. If you haven't used [Grunt](http://gruntjs.com/) before, be sure to check out the [Getting Started](http://gruntjs.com/getting-started) guide first.

Run `npm start` from the command line for development which will:

- run tests
- lint JavaScript and SCSS
- build the required assets (JS/CSS/web fonts)
- serve the development site
- watch for change to source files

There are also other commands you can run:

#### npm

Run `npm start` and `npm run test:watch` for development. However, there are other npm scripts available to be run for other tasks:

| Task | Description |
| ---- | ----------- |
| `npm start`           | Simply runs `grunt` under the hood |
| `npm run dist`           | Builds the projects in distribution mode for release |
| `npm run dist:teamcity`           | Builds the projects in distribution mode for release via teamcity |
| `npm test`            | Runs JS tests |
| `npm test:teamcity`            | Runs JS tests (with the [mocha-teamcity-reporter](https://www.npmjs.com/package/mocha-teamcity-reporter))|
| `npm run test:watch`  | Runs JS test tests (with [min reporter](https://github.com/mochajs/mocha/blob/master/lib/reporters/min.js)) and watches for changes. Useful to run in development alongside grunt. |
| `npm run test:coverage`  | Runs JS test tests and generates a coverage report with [Istanbul](https://istanbul.js.org/) into the *coverage* folder |
| `test:coverage:teamcity` | Runs JS test tests and generates a coverage report with [Istanbul](https://istanbul.js.org/) (using the [mocha-teamcity-reporter](https://www.npmjs.com/package/mocha-teamcity-reporter)). |
| `npm run lint`        | Lints SASS and JS (uses `grunt lint` under the hood) |

| `npm run release`        | Builds the assets in dist mode, increments package.json patch version, pushes a new git tag, creates a GitHub release (with release notes from commits since last release) and creates an npm release. |
| `npm run release:minor` | Does the same as release but with a minor version |


#### Grunt

Some of the npm scripts use Grunt tasks under the hood. These Grunt tasks (and aliases) can be run directly e.g. `grunt lint`. However, we recommend using the npm scripts themselves. See the task aliases in [Gruntfile.js#L35-L47](Gruntfile.js) for more information.

### JavaScript

See the [javascript](src/javascripts#readme) folder for more information.

### SASS

See the [stylesheets](src/stylesheets#readme) folder for more information.

### Icons

Icons are used via a separate package, [NICE Icons](https://github.com/nice-digital/nice-icons#readme).

## Tests

See the [test](test) folder for more information.

## Installation

### Install with yarn

[yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/en/package/@nice-digital/design-system) is the recommended way of installing the NICE Design System into your project. Run the following from the command line to install it as a dependency:

`yarn add @nice-digital/design-system -D`

Then follow the [usage](#usage) steps below...

> Note: if you prefer to use npm rather than yarn, run npm `npm i @nice-digital/design-system --save` instead.

> Note: The [Design System is on Bower](https://bower.io/search/?q=nice-design-system), but this installation method is unsupported.

The installed package contains:

- source SASS
- pre-compiled (dist) CSS
- source (ES6) JavaScript
- pre-compiled (dist) JavaScript
- static assets like favicon and logo.

Note: The icon font is referenced as a dependency from [@nice-digital/icons](https://github.com/nice-digital/nice-icons#readme).

### Usage

#### From source

The yarn/npm package contains the source code as well as the precompiled assets.

See the [stylesheets directory](src/stylesheets#installation) for further information on how to build from SASS source in your project.

See the [javascripts directory](src/javascripts#installation) for further information on how to build from JavaScript source in your project.

#### CDN

- Useful for rapid prototyping
- no need for CSS/JS build steps: just reference the pre-compiled CSS/JS
- uses compiled CSS so loses the benefit of SASS mixins, function and variables
- you get everything: you can’t pick and choose just what you need
- not recommended for production setups.

*CDN is coming soon…*

#### Precompiled

Not recommended for production, but useful for quick prototypes, the npm package includes a dist folder with precompiled assets.

You can reference directly if you have the correct permissions:

```html
<!-- Font from Google & compiled/minified CSS -->
<link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Lato:300,400,400i,700" rel="stylesheet">
<link rel="stylesheet" href="/node_modules/@nice-digital/design-system/dist/stylesheets/nice.min.css">

<!-- jQuery from CDN & compiled/minified JavaScript -->
<script src="https://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/3.1.0/jquery.min.js"></script>
<script src="/node_modules/@nice-digital/design-system/dist/javascripts/nice.min.js"></script>
```

OR if you're using express you can use the dist folder as a static directory:

```javascript
app.use(express.static(__dirname + "/node_modules/@nice-digital/design-system/dist/"));
app.use(express.static(__dirname + "/node_modules/@nice-digital/icons/dist/"));
```

and then reference it from your HTML as:

```html
<link rel="stylesheet" href="/stylesheets/nice.min.css" type="text/css">
<script src="/javascripts/nice.min.js"></script>
```

OR you can use a copy command (with Grunt or similar) to copy the compiled assets out of the *node_modules* folder to somewhere where you can serve them.
