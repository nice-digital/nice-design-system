# Tests

## Tools

We use the following tools for running front-end unit tests:

* [Mocha](http://mochajs.org/) as our test framework
* [Chai](http://chaijs.com/) and [Should](http://chaijs.com/guide/styles/#should) for assertions
* [Sinon](http://sinonjs.org/) for spies, stubs and mocks
* [Istanbul](http://gotwarlost.github.io/istanbul/) for coverage reports

## Running the tests

* `npm test`
* `npm run test:watch`
* `npm run test:coverage`

## Writing tests

	Tests are code too

- Follow the same code style as regular code
- Tests can be in ES6
- Code review tests
